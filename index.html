      <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>The Reality We See</h2>
        <p>
          Our masjids are doing amazing work, but we're often disconnected from each other. 
          Events get missed, youth programs overlap, and families struggle to find what they need. 
          We're building bridges where gaps exist.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- WHAT WE'RE BUILDING -->
      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>What We're Creating</h2>
        <p>
          Think of imamah as a simple digital hub where your masjid can share events, 
          coordinate with other organizations, and help community members find what they need— 
          all in one place. No complexity, just connection.
